https://github.com/vefforritun/book/blob/master/chapters/02.css.md
```
* ` ` þýðir að seinni selector velur element sem er afkomandi fyrri

* `+` er fyrir _systkini_, seinni selector velur element sem er systkini sem kemur **beint á eftir** fyrri selector
* `~` er almennur systkina selector, seinni selector velur element sem er syskini fyrri

```css
*              /* öll element */
div            /* öll div */
div p          /* öllu p, afkomendur p */
div > p        /* öll p sem eru börn div */
p + p          /* öll p með p sem fyrra systkyni */
div.foo        /* öll div með class foo */
a:hover        /* öll a sem verið að hovera á */

**1.15 What is the result of running the following JavaScript code?**

console.log(result);
```

- a. 21
